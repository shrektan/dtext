# Kit for data.table

This package provides some useful helper functions to work with [data.table](http://r-datatable.com).

Since these are helper functions, the function names are usually concise and may cause conflict with other R packages. Thus, I suggest people use the package without explicitly *attaching* it. In other words, please call the function with `dtkit::fun()`.
